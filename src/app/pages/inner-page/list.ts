                        <p>SSL Encryption: Using 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is an industry-standard practice for securing data transmission between your website and users' browsers. This ensures that sensitive information, such as personal and  payment data, is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties during transmission.</p>
                        <p>No Storage of Card Data: Not capturing or storing credit or debit card details on your website is a strong security practice. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and protects your customers' financial information.</p>
                        <p>Payment Gateway: Redirecting clients to the acquiring bank's payment gateway for transaction completion is a secure approach. Payment gateways are typically designed with robust security measures to handle sensitive financial data securely.</p>
                        <p>Non-Storage of Card Information: Clearly stating that credit card or debit card information is not stored in any retrieval or storage system of Dreamland Travel reinforces the trustworthiness of your payment process.</p>
                        <p>Data Security Compliance: Ensure that you comply with industry standards and regulations related to payment data security, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Even if you don't store card data, compliance with these standards demonstrates a commitment to security.</p>
                        <p>Regular Security Audits: Consider conducting regular security audits and assessments to verify that your payment process remains secure over time.</p>
                        <p>Customer Awareness: Educate your customers about the security measures you've implemented to boost their confidence in making online payments on your website.</p>
                        <p>Incident Response Plan: Develop a clear incident response plan to address any potential security incidents swiftly and effectively.</p>

                            <li>Lost or Delayed Baggage: If your luggage is lost, stolen or delayed travel insurance can provide compensation for your belongings.</li>
                            <li>Trip Interruption: If your trip is cut short due to covered reasons, travel insurance can reimburse the unused portion of your trip and additional expenses incurred.</li>
