Earlier hoteliers used to deny the local couples as they wanted to give preference to the guests who traveled from far as they usually occupy the room for more days but local couples hardly book a room for one day. However, due to the growing number of startups in the hotel industry, local couples can also book hotel rooms.</p><p>There are some specific hotels which don't allow check-in with local ID proof but most of these are accepted now. Before booking a hotel, you may check on our website if someone can book a hotel with a local I'd proof or not. But most of the hotels allow check-in with a valid ID proof.</p>"},{qtn:"How can I get early check-in or late check-out in a hotel?",ans:"<p>Early check-ins or late checkouts in hotels are subject to availability and customers have to ask about this directly from the hotels. If a hotel reception is accommodating, they can provide their guests with both Early Check-in and Late Check-out or at least one of these. However, it also depends if rooms are available in the hotel or not. Usually, guests can enjoy free early check-in or late check-out of up to 2 hours.</p>"},{qtn:"How can unmarried couples book hotels in india?",ans:"<p>No law denies the stay of unmarried couples from booking and staying in a hotel. However, it solely depends on the hotel authority to allow check-ins in such hotels. Choosing to stay together is a personal choice, which can't be restricted.</p><p>Unmarried couples should always try to book their hotels online for 2 persons by checking earlier if the hotel provides them entry or not. Here is a tip, unmarried couples or any couple shouldn't indulge in activities that unnecessarily draw the attention of people. Generally, hotel reception checks the id proofs and then allows the guests to check-in without making any fuss about if they are unmarried or married.</p>"},{qtn:"How can I book cheap hotel rooms in 5 star hotels?",ans:"<p>There are several 5-star hotels in various cities that are available at cheaper rates. To book cheap hotel rooms in 5-star hotels, one of the most important things that you can do is to be flexible about your dates. If you are not planning to travel during weekends, a stay can be booked at very cheaper rates.</p><p>One more tip is to book hotels in the off-season. By booking a hotel room at a location where there is a lesser crowd during a particular weather, customers can get really cheap deals. Suppose if you are only looking for a staycation or are willing to stay in 5-star hotels, then you can choose to visit cities like Jaipur, Agra or any tourist place in Northern India during the summers. Booking hotels at hill stations during the rainy season can also be an opportunity to get rooms at cheaper rates.</p>"},{qtn:"How do I contact customer support for hotel-related inquiries on Dreamland Travel?",ans:"<p>Contacting Dreamland Travel's customer support is easy.
